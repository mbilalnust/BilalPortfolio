## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed on your system

- (Optional) A Google account for creating contact forms

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone or Fork This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbilalnust/BilalPortfolio.git
cd BilalPortfolio
```

Or use this repository as a template by clicking "Use this template" on GitHub.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure for Your Repository

**Important**: If you're using a different repository name, update the base path:

1. Open `vite.config.ts`
2. Update the `base` field to match your repository name:
   ```typescript
   base: '/YourRepositoryName/', // Replace with your actual repository name
   ```
3. Update `package.json`:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/YourRepositoryName/"
   ```

### 4. Customize Your Content

Edit `data.ts` to update:
- Profile information (name, title, bio, avatar, location, email)
- Social media links
- Work experience
- Education
- Projects
- Blog posts

### 5. Set Up Google Forms Contact Form

1. Go to [Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms)
2. Create a new form with your desired fields
3. Click "Send" button (top right)
4. Click the `</>` (Embed HTML) icon
5. Copy the `src` URL from the iframe code
6. Paste it into `data.ts` as the `GOOGLE_FORM_URL` value

See the detailed instructions in `data.ts` comments for more details.

### 6. Connect to your chatbot backend (for live Q&A)

The chat widget now calls a backend API. Set the URL via Vite env:
1. Create `.env.local` in the project root.
2. Add:  
   `VITE_CHAT_API_URL=https://<your-backend-domain-or-tunnel>/chat`

If you’re running the FastAPI backend on your laptop, start it and expose it (e.g., with `ngrok http 8000`), then paste that HTTPS URL here.

For GitHub Pages deployment, add a repo secret `CHAT_API_URL` with your public backend URL and the workflow will inject it at build time.

### 7. Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see your portfolio.

### 8. Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

This template uses GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Setup GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository's **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Build and deployment**, select:
   - **Source**: `GitHub Actions`
3. The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to `main`

### Automatic Deployment

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch:
1. GitHub Actions automatically triggers
2. Builds your React app
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages
4. Your site updates at `https://yourusername.github.io/YourRepositoryName/`

No manual deployment needed! Just commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio content"
git push origin main
```

Monitor deployments in the **Actions** tab of your repository.

## Customization Guide

### Updating Content

All content is managed in `data.ts`. Edit the following exports:

- **`PROFILE`**: Your personal information, skills, avatar
- **`SOCIAL_LINKS`**: Links to your social profiles
- **`EXPERIENCE`**: Work experience entries
- **`EDUCATION`**: Educational background
- **`PROJECTS`**: Portfolio projects with images and links
- **`BLOG_POSTS`**: Blog posts or publications
- **`GOOGLE_FORM_URL`**: Contact form embed URL

### Styling

- Styles use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Custom colors are defined in `index.html` (Tailwind config)
- Component styles are in individual component files under `components/`
- Global styles can be added to `index.html` `<style>` tag

### Adding New Sections

1. Create a new component in `components/`
2. Import and add it to `App.tsx`
3. Optionally add corresponding data types in `types.ts`
4. Add data in `data.ts` if needed

### Changing Images

- Update image URLs in `data.ts` for projects and blog posts
- Use absolute URLs or add images to a `public/` folder
- For GitHub-hosted images, use the `raw` URL from your repository

## Google Forms Setup (Detailed)

The contact form uses an embedded Google Form. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Create a Google Form**:
   - Go to https://docs.google.com/forms
   - Create a new form with fields you want (name, email, message, etc.)
   - Customize the form theme if desired

2. **Get the Embed URL**:
   - Click the "Send" button (top right)
   - Click the `</>` (Embed HTML) icon/tab
   - You'll see an iframe code like:
     ```html
     <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd.../viewform?embedded=true" ...></iframe>
     ```
   - Copy **only the URL** from the `src` attribute (the part between quotes)

3. **Add to Your Portfolio**:
   - Open `data.ts`
   - Find `GOOGLE_FORM_URL`
   - Paste your embed URL:
     ```typescript
     export const GOOGLE_FORM_URL = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/.../viewform?embedded=true";
     ```

4. **Test**:
   - The form will appear in the Contact section of your portfolio
   - Make sure the form is set to accept responses

## Troubleshooting

### Site shows blank page after deployment

1. Check that `vite.config.ts` has the correct base path matching your repository name
2. Verify GitHub Pages is set to use "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. Check the Actions tab for any build errors
4. Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment for changes to propagate

### Contact form not showing

- Verify `GOOGLE_FORM_URL` in `data.ts` is set correctly
- Ensure you copied the full embed URL from Google Forms
- Check that the Google Form is published and accepting responses

### Build errors

- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that Node.js version is 20 or higher
- Review error messages in the GitHub Actions logs
